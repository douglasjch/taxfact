description: Employment Taxes Collected Indirectly
---

- The original intent and purpose of the income tax was to reach the very wealthy and corporations, the robber barrons of the time.

- Since wage and employment taxes are indirect taxes, the 16th Amendment does not authorize them and is not applicable to wage earners. [Moore v. United States, 602 U.S. 572 (2024)](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/23pdf/22-800_jg6o.pdf) stated that:
"Because income taxes are indirect taxes, they are permitted under Article I, §8 without apportionment."

- Removing wage earners from the income tax system would return the tax to its original intent of taxing wealth.

- For wage earners, every single cent of employment taxes are funded by employers as a cost of employment and is included in the cost of 
payrolls and employment.

- Removing those who earn less that 215,000 per year from the income tax system would eliminate over 90% of tax filings and IRS personel,
 returning the income tax to its original intent.

I have asked legislators to consider this Petition:

It doesn't take an economist to see that employers also pay employees the money to pay their taxes. In fact, employers remit part of their own payroll
to the government as the withholding tax. Consumers ultimately pay these taxes because employers recoup costs by passing them on.
