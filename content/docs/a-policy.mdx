## Indirect Income Taxation Policies

The original intent of federal income taxation was to tax those who had the ability to pay, which for the first 70 years of operation had subjected only two to 
five percent of the population.[^1] One of the founding principles of our Constitution was to free citizens of direct taxes unless emergencies should arise. 
Expectations were to tax duties, imports, and tariffs without resorting to direct taxes to fund the government.[^2] The founders’ apportionment rule was meant to make 
direct taxes on wealth difficult. [^3] [^4]

Our Constitution establishes income taxes, duties, and excises to be levied on economic events and not directed at individuals. The law of the land, embodied 
in our Constitution, requires that taxes on individuals must follow the rule of apportionment.[^5] 

A return to the original intent of income tax laws is to enforce “billionaires to pay taxes annually by eliminating the ability of high income and high net worth 
taxpayers to use tax planning strategies such as “buy, borrow, die” to defer paying taxes indefinitely…”[^6] “We The People”,  the majority of the populace, suffer 
greatly under a “K- shaped” economy where there is a concentration of wealth in the top 3% of the population.[^7]

The Constitution permits Congress to tax wage earners indirectly “at the source”, as a true excise tax, but prohibits levying various wage income tax provisions as a 
direct tax without apportionment. According to the IRS, foreign governments, and worldwide literature, the income tax is called a direct tax.[^8] [^9] By contrast, the 
Supreme Court has consistently ruled that the income tax is an indirect tax. [^10] [^11]

### Class Struggle between Capital vs Labor
 [^12] [^13] [^14]

In 1894 the Supreme Court declared income derived from capital to be direct taxation requiring apportionment, while steadfastly holding that labor income, or income 
from earning wages, was forms of duties and/or excise taxes that fell under the classification of indirect taxation that need not be apportioned. This decision would 
have relieved real estate and invested personal property from income taxation, but instead declared the whole income tax act unconstitutional because that:

 > "...would leave the burden of the tax to be borne by professions, trades, employments, or vacations, and in that way what was intended as a tax on capital would 
 > remain, in substance, a tax on occupations and labor"[Pollock v. Farmers' Loan & Trust Co., 157 U.S. 429 (1895)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/157/429/) [^15]

The Supreme Court has told us that the 16th Amendment did not create or destroy the plenary powers of taxation, but only “that the Amendment was drawn for the 
purpose of doing away for the future with the principle upon which the Pollock case was decided.” [^16]  The Court further stated that:

> “the contention that the Amendment treats a tax on income as a direct tax although it is relieved from apportionment and is necessarily therefore not subject to 
> the rule of uniformity as such rule only applies to taxes which are not direct, thus destroying the two great classifications which have been recognized and 
> enforced from the beginning, is also wholly without foundation since the command of the Amendment that all income taxes shall not be subject to apportionment 
> by a consideration of the sources from which the taxed income may be derived forbids the application to such taxes of the rule applied in the Pollock case by 
> which alone such taxes were removed from the great class of excises, duties, and imposts subject to the rule of uniformity, and were placed under the other or 
> direct class. [^17]
The 16th Amendment allows Congress to levy income taxes without apportionment to directly overcome the obstacles that the Pollock decision presented. The Supreme 
Court recently reaffirmed that opinion with this:

“Because income taxes are indirect taxes, they are permitted under Article I, §8 without apportionment” (Moore v. US, 2024).

“Therefore, the Sixteenth Amendment expressly confirmed what had been the understanding of the Constitution before Pollock: Taxes on income—including taxes on 
income from property—are indirect taxes that need not be apportioned. Brushaber, 240 U. S., at 15, 18.” 

With unbroken and unwavering continuity, taxes on occupations and labor have always been classified as indirect taxes without any context or reference to the 16th 
Amendment; this remains the law of the land.[^18]

Consequently, the IRS informs us that income taxes are, in fact, a direct tax.[^19] In contrast, the Supreme Court would allow the shift of indirect taxes to consumers:

 > As the means by which the burdens of taxes may be shifted are as multiform and as various as is the power to contract itself, it follows that the argument relied 
 > on, if adopted, would control almost every conceivable form of contract, and render them void if they had the result stated. Thus, the price of all property, the 
 > result of all production, the sum of all wages, would be controlled irrevocably by a law levying taxes if such a law forbade a shifting of the burden of the tax 
 > and avoided all acts which brought about that result. It cannot be doubted that to adopt by implication the view pressed upon us would be to virtually destroy all 
 > freedom of contract, and in its final analyses would deny the existence of all rights of property. American Express Co. v. Michigan, 177 U.S. 404 (1900) 

In juxtaposition, the income tax is classified as an indirect tax by the Supreme Court does not escape the nature, function, and 
form, as a direct tax applied to vocations and wage earners in the form of creating personal liability.

The income tax code should apply to income and not directly onto the individual; it is not a tax on wealth, but a tax excised on the creation of wealth through labor and/or capital in the marketplace.
> “If it be true that, by varying the form, the substance may be changed, it is not easy to see that anything would remain of the limitations of the Constitution, or 
> of the rule of taxation and representation, so carefully recognized and guarded in favor of the citizens of each State. But constitutional provisions cannot be thus 
> evaded. It is the substance, and not the form, which controls, as has indeed been established by repeated decisions of this court.[^20]

Indirect taxes were preferred by the framers of the Constitution, with Alexander Hamilton noting that indirect taxes “must always constitute the chief part of the 
revenue raised in this country.”[^21]

## Highlighted Reasons 
- Increase revenue by “collection at the source” excise policies. [^22] 
- Massively reduce the number of individual income tax filings. [^23]
- Massively reduce citizen hours of compliance and enforcement agents. [^24]
- Reduce intrusiveness into personal affairs under penalty of perjury. [^25]
- Savings in record-keeping freeing up billions of hours of record keeping. [^26]
- Free the burden of requiring most wage earners to file reports. [^27]
- Excise-based source withholding generates enforceability of collection on employers. [^28]
- Simplified Tax Compliance. [^29]
- Reduced Administrative Costs. [^30]
- More Predictable and Stable Government Revenue with Greater Equity and Consistency. [^31]
- Fewer Enforcement Actions Needed with Increased Taxpayer Satisfaction.
- Promote Economic Efficiency. [^32]

## Removing Low Income Filers Proposal

**Revenue would stabilize and increase as compliance reaches 100% with excise-based withholding at the source.
Removing filers who earn under $215,169 would remove over 150 million filers. (2022 most recent)**
