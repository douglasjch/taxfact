## Pre-Constitutional Economic History

**Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot** (1727 – 1781) Tax collector, physiocratic, economist, and statesman, was a key figure in the development of economic thought in the 
18th century. He is best known for his work on the nature of wealth and the role of government in the economy. Turgot's ideas on taxation were 
particularly influential, as he argued for a system of taxation that would be fair and equitable, while also promoting economic growth.
He believed that taxes should be based on the ability to pay, and that they should be used to fund public goods and services that benefit 
society as a whole. Turgot's work laid the groundwork for modern economic theory, and inspired other influential economic writers including 
Adam Smith, Thomas Paine, etc. Famous for his work on the nature of wealth and the role of government in the economy, Turgot's ideas on 
taxation were particularly influential.
