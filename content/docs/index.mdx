 ## "Direct taxes and Indirect Taxes" are paid by workers and laborers.

 The Founding Fathers had a distaste for direct taxes. They believed that direct taxes were a form of oppression and would lead to inequity of 
 suffrage and VOICExxx. 
 They preferred indirect taxes, which they believed were less intrusive and more equitable.


> During the ratification process (1787-90) many people objected to granting Congress any power to lay direct taxes. They feared that Congress 
> might raise the overall burden and undo whatever progress toward equity states had achieved during the war. At least nine state conventions 
> considered motions for constitutional amendments restricting the federal direct-tax power. [Case Western Reserve Law Review·Volume 66·Issue 2·2015
