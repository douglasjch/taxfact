title: Direct Taxes
description: Internal Revenue Service classifies income taxes as a DIRECT TAX
---

[Employment taxes are indirect taxes by definition. We can eliminate 160 million income tax filers (here)](/docs/a-policy)

In approaching this subject, congressional enactments levying taxes, as other laws of the federal government when acting within constitutional 
authority, are the supreme law of the land. However, observers note that Supreme Court rulings have upheld the classification of income 
taxes as **indirect taxes**, while the rest of the world has [classified income taxes as direct taxes,](/docs/b-pubs) including the [Internal Revenue Service.](https://apps.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/teacher/whys_thm04_les04.jsp)

The Supreme Court has repeatedly sustained employment **income taxes** and other excise taxes as **indirect taxes**, and  has never ruled otherwise.
> We think that they were used comprehensively to cover customs and excise duties imposed on importation, consumption, manufacture, and sale 
> of certain commodities, privileges, particular business transactions, vocations, occupations, and the 
> like. [Thomas v. United States, 192 U.S. 363 (1904)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/192/363/)

But the reality exists that individual income taxes can be direct taxes. These taxes attach to individuals in a direct manner which creates a personal liability, 
as opposed to indirect taxes which falls onto acts or transactions and collected in the course of commerce and trade.
The founding fathers knew that labor and property(wealth) were the proper subjects of direct taxation; they cited Adam Smith and others in their
debates concerning the subject of direct taxes. 

> The great object of the Constitution was, to give Congress a power to lay taxes, adequate to the exigencies of government; but they were to 
> observe...the rule of apportionment, according to the census, when they laid any direct tax.
> [Hylton v. United States, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 171, 173 (1796) (opinion of Chase, J.)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/3/171) 

The Founding Fathers had a distaste for direct taxes; they believed that direct taxes could be oppressive and burdensome. For this reason, they
included **two** provisions in the Constitution that required direct taxes to be apportioned among the states based on their population. This meant that
each state would pay a share of the direct tax based on the number of people living in that state, and would be represented proportionately.
The Supreme Court has always held that taxes on wealth, land, and persons are direct taxes while maintaining that income taxes are indirect taxes.
Conversely, the opinion of the world, including the IRS, find that income taxes are direct taxes. 
This is [evidenced in ALL investment literature and in ALL foreign taxing authorities.](/docs/b-pubs)

### The founders preferred indirect taxes, as less intrusive and more equitable

 > As we have found it necessary to give very extensive powers to the federal government both over the persons and estates of the citizens, 
 > we thought it right to draw one branch of the legislature immediately from the people, and that both wealth and numbers should be considered 
 > in the representation. We were at a loss, for some time, for a rule to ascertain the proportionate wealth of the states. At last we thought 
 > that the productive labor of the inhabitants was the best rule for ascertaining their wealth. In conformity to this rule, joined to a spirit 
 > of concession, we determined that representatives should be apportioned among the several states,.. We thus obtained a representation for 
 > our property;

  Mr Goudy opposed the direct taxing clause because it would allow Negroes to be counted in the census, and thus increase the number of 
 representatives from slave states. Mr. Goudy stated:
 >  Taxes are equal to our representation... I wish not to be represented with negroes, especially if it increases my burdens.
> Mr Davie replied:

> > It was attempted to form a rule of representation from a compound ratio of wealth and population; but, on consideration, it was found

> > and population alone was adopted as the only practicable rule or criterion of representation.

> ...there had been a general concurrence in a belief that the ultimate sources of public contributions were labor, and the subjects and 
> effects of labor; that taxes, being permanent, had a tendency to equalize, and to diffuse themselves through a community. According to these 
> opinions, a capitation tax, and taxes on land, and on property and income generally, were a direct charge, as well in the immediate as 
> ultimate sources of contribution. He had considered those, and those only, as direct taxes in their operation and effects. On the other hand, 
> a tax imposed on a specific article of personal property, and particularly of objects of luxury, as in the case under consideration, he had 
> never supposed had been considered a direct tax within the meaning of the Constitution.

> Wednesday, January 23. — Mr. PIERCE rose, he said, to make a few observations on the powers of Congress, in this section.

> Mr. Madison, June 16, 1788:  Let us consider the most important of these reprobated powers; that of direct taxation is most generally objected to. With respect to the 
> exigencies of government, there is no question but the most easy mode of providing for them will be adopted. When, therefore, direct taxes are 
> not necessary, they will not be recurred to. It can be of little advantage to those in power to raise money in a manner oppressive to the 
> people. To consult the conveniences of the people will cost them nothing, and in many respects will be advantageous to them. Direct taxes will 
> only be recurred to for great purposes. [The Debates in the Several State Conventions vol. 3](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/elliot-the-debates-in-the-several-state-conventions-vol-3)

Mr. CORBIN on June 7, 1788
> concluded that no danger was to be apprehended from the power of direct taxation, since there was every reason to believe 
> it would be very seldom used. ...and if this conclusion of mine be well founded, let me ask if public liberty is not secured by bars and

> liberty insecure? Sir, without this power, other powers will answer no purpose. Government cannot exist without the means of procuring money. 
> My honorable friend told us he considered this clause as the vitals of the Constitution. I will change the phrase, and say that I consider this

> dangerous if the principles of equal and free representation be fully attended to. While the right of suffrage is secured, we have little to 
> fear. This government, sir, fully secures us this noble privilege, on the purest and simplest principles of equality. That number which, in any 
> one part of the country, has a right to send a representative, has the same right in another part. What does the Constitution say? That thirty 
> thousand shall have one representative, no matter where. If this be not equal representation, what, in the name of God, is equal representation? 
> But, says the honorable gentleman, the Constitution may be satisfied by one from each state. I conceive there is no fear of this. There is 
> not a power to diminish the number. Does it not say that representatives shall be apportioned according to the number of the people, and 
> that direct taxes shall be regulated by the same rules?

> But, I trust, this power of imposing direct taxes has been proved to be essential to the very existence of the Union. The advocates for the

Mr. JOHN MARSHALL on June 7, 1788 [The Debates in the Several State Conventions vol. 3](https://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/elliot-the-debates-in-the-several-state-conventions-vol-3)
> The objects of direct taxes are well understood: they are but few: what are they? Lands, slaves, stock of all kinds, and a few other articles of domestic property.
> ...No tax can be laid without the consent of the House of Representatives. If there be no impropriety in the mode of electing the representatives, 
> can any danger be apprehended?
> ... I think that the power of direct taxation is essential to the existence of the general government, and that it is safe to grant it. 
> If this power be not necessary, and as safe from abuse as any delegated power can possibly be, then I say that the plan before you is 
> unnecessary; for it imports not what system we have, unless it have the power of protecting us in time of peace and war.

### Direct taxation was meant to be difficult, rare and infrequent
The restriction that all direct taxes must be apportioned was [inserted twice into the Constitution.](https://indirect-taxes.link/docs/directTaxes)

> During the ratification process (1787-90) many people objected to granting Congress any power to lay direct taxes. They feared that Congress 
> might raise the overall burden and undo whatever progress toward equity states had achieved during the war. At least nine state conventions 
> considered motions for constitutional amendments restricting the federal direct-tax power. [Case Western Reserve Law Review·Volume 66·Issue 2·2015 
> What the Constitution Means by “Duties, Imposts, and Excises”—and “Taxes” (Direct or Otherwise) ](https://i2i.org/wp-content/uploads/tax-article-pdf-final.pdf)

## All Indirect Employment Taxes are Funded by Employers
Employers pay taxes on their employees' labor as a cost of doing business. Employment costs can include insurance, training, benefits,
retirements, and taxes. In economics, the cost of the employees wage income taxes are funded only by the employers payroll; and can never be otherwise. These costs are 
then passed onto the consumer in the form of higher prices for goods and services, or possibly reduced profits or wages.

If the income taxes on employee wages were truly an indirect tax, the employer would be collecting any taxes due and relieve the employee of any tax liability.
Here are indirect taxes on labor that neither the employee nor employer can adjust funded by employer payrolls:

Some day folks will realize that all employment taxes are indirect taxes funded solely by employers as a cost of doing business. Some day folks will
employers will be able to advertise per-hour take home pay rates that are not reduced by any taxes or deductions that would come out of the employees pockets.
