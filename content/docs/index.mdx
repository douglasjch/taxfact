title: Direct Taxes
description: Income Tax is a Direct Tax yet Classified as an Indirect Tax
---

In approaching this subject, congressional enactments levying taxes, as other laws of the federal government when acting within constitutional 
authority, are the supreme law of the land. However, observers note that Supreme Court rulings have always upheld the classification of income 
taxes as indirect taxes, while the rest of the world has [classified income taxes as direct taxes,](/docs/pubs) including the [IRS.](https://apps.irs.gov/app/understandingTaxes/teacher/whys_thm04_les04.jsp)

The Supreme Court has repeatedly sustained income taxes and excise taxes as indirect taxes, and  has never ruled otherwise.

But the reality remains that individual income taxes are direct taxes. These taxes attach to individuals in a direct manner and create liability, 
as oppose to indirect taxes which falls onto acts or transactions and collected in the course of commerce and trade.
The founding fathers knew that labor and property or wealth were the proper subjects of direct taxation; they cited Adam Smith and others in their
debates concerning the subject of direct taxes. 

> The great object of the Constitution was, to give Congress a power to lay taxes, adequate to the exigencies of government; but they were to 
> observe...the rule of apportionment, according to the census, when they laid any direct tax.
> [Hylton v. United States, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 171, 173 (1796) (opinion of Chase, J.)](https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/3/171) 

The Founding Fathers had a distaste for direct taxes; they believed that direct taxes could be oppressive and burdensome. For this reason, they
included **two** provisions in the Constitution that required direct taxes to be apportioned among the states based on their population. This meant that
each state would pay a share of the direct tax based on the number of people living in that state, and would be represented proportionately.
History has shown that taxes on wealth, land, and labor are direct taxes in practice and opperation; 
this is the opinion of the world, [found in ALL investment literature and in ALL foreign taxing authorities.](/docs/pubs)

### They preferred indirect taxes, as less intrusive and more equitable.

 > As we have found it necessary to give very extensive powers to the federal government both over the persons and estates of the citizens,

 Mr Goudy opposed the direct taxing clause because it would allow Negroes to be counted in the census, and thus increase the number of 
 representatives from slave states. Mr. Goudy stated:
 >  Taxes are equal to our representation... I wish not to be represented with negroes, especially if it increases my burdens.

> ...there had been a general concurrence in a belief that the ultimate sources of public contributions were labor, and the subjects and 
> effects of labor; that taxes, being permanent, had a tendency to equalize, and to diffuse themselves through a community. According to these 
> opinions, a capitation tax, and taxes on land, and on property and income generally, were a direct charge, as well in the immediate as 
> ultimate sources of contribution. He had considered those, and those only, as direct taxes in their operation and effects. On the other hand, 
> a tax imposed on a specific article of personal property, and particularly of objects of luxury, as in the case under consideration, he had

> Mr. Madison, June 16, 1788:  Let us consider the most important of these reprobated powers; that of direct taxation is most generally objected to. With respect to the

Mr. CORBIN on June 7, 1788

> thousand shall have one representative, no matter where. If this be not equal representation, what, in the name of God, is equal representation? 
> But, says the honorable gentleman, the Constitution may be satisfied by one from each state. I conceive there is no fear of this. There is 
> not a power to diminish the number. Does it not say that representatives shall be apportioned according to the number of the people, and 
> that direct taxes shall be regulated by the same rules?

> The objects of direct taxes are well understood: they are but few: what are they? Lands, slaves, stock of all kinds, and a few other articles of domestic property.

Wednesday, January 23. — Mr. PIERCE rose, he said, to make a few observations on the powers of Congress, in this section.

### The restriction that all direct taxes must 
be apportioned was [inserted twice into the Constitution.](https://indirect-taxes.link/docs/directTaxes)

> During the ratification process (1787-90) many people objected to granting Congress any power to lay direct taxes. They feared that Congress
